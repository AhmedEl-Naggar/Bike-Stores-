The SQL script (SQLQuery1.BikeStore.sql) includes multiple queries designed to extract insights from the BikeStore dataset. These queries are structured, commented, and grouped for clarity.
They cover essential analytics tasks including:

Customer information retrieval

Sales order analysis

Product performance

Discount and revenue calculations

Aggregated KPIs for decision-making
